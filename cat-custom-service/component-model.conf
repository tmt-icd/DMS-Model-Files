      The Custom Object Catalog Service is present at the summit to allow authorized users/clients to add, modify, replace, or delete object entries
      in catalogs during observing. The service supports an Administration API and a Subsystem API because the two APIs have different authorization roles.
      Searching is provided by IVOA standard Cone Search and TAP Seach APIs.
