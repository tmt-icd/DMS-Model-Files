  description: |-
    This administration API for the TIO Guide Star Catalog or TIOGSC is a secure API allowing changes 
    to catalog entries. Administrative changes require authentication and the
    authenticated user must be authorized with the DMS.CAT admin role in the 
    token received from the CSW Authorization and Authentication Service. The token must
    be provided in the request header.
